\item \code{CCSbounds}
\item \code{Steel_Production}: Steel production estimates
\item \code{industry_max_secondary_steel_share}: Maximum share of secondary steel
production in total steel production and years between which a linear
convergence from historic to target shares is to be applied.
\item \code{cement_production_convergence_parameters}: convergence year and level
(relative to global average) to which per-capita cement demand converges
\item \code{ies}
\item \code{prtp}
\item \code{tradeConstraints}: parameter by Nicolas Bauer (2024) for the region
