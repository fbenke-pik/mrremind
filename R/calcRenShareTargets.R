#' Calculate Renewable Energy Share Targets
#'
#' @description This function calculates the renewable energy share targets by aggregating country-level targets to targets of REMIND regions. It calculates
#' the following types of share targets: 1) share of renewables in electricity, 2) share of non-biomass renewables in electricty,
#' 3) share of non-fossil generation in  electricity, 4) share of renewables in total final energy.
#' First, targets are aggregated to one of these 4 types. Second, countries without targets are assumed to maintain their renewable share from 2020.
#' Third, targets are harmonized within a REMIND region and filtered based on how many countries within a REMIND region have a target. Finally, energy share targets are aggregated from country-level
#' to REMIND region-level using projections of electricity or final energy demand on country-level. These country-level projections are
#' derived from final energy trends by REMIND regions from the EDGE models as well as GDP trends by country from SSP scenarios (see toolCalcEnergyProj).

calcRenShareTargets <- function(scenario) {
  # The aggregation of renewable share targets from countries to REMIND regions is done with the following method:
  # RenShareTarget(REMINDregion,targetYear) = sum over all countries of
  # TotalDemand(country,targetYear) / TotalDemand(REMINDregion,targetYear) * RenShareTarget(country,targetYear).
  # RenShareTarget - is the renewable share target
  # TotalDemand - is the total demand,
  # i.e. in case of renewable electricity share targets it is total final electricity demand,
  # in case of renewable final energy share targets it is total final energy demand
  # for countries without targt it is assumed that they maintain their renewable share in the target year:
  # RenShareTarget(countriesWithoutTarget,targetYear) = historical renewable share
  # TotalDemand(country,targetYear) is calculated by toolCalcEnergyProj() based on FE trajectories of EDGE models and GDP from SSP scenarios
  # The function prepares RenShareTarget and TotalDemand and provides it as arguments x and weight respectively to the madrat aggregation routine,
  # which implements the above method.

  # The preparation makes the following steps:
  # 1. get data and select target types to be considered
  # 2. get historic renewable shares and totals
  # 3. extrapolate targets to REMIND time steps
  # 4. make assumptions about target development over time for countries with and without target
  # 5. select which REMIND regions get targets and determine their respective target year
  # 6. get total demand in target year to be used as aggregation weights
  # 7. hand-over to madrat for aggregation via weighted sum
